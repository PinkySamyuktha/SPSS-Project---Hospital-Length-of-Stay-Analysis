# Hospital Length of Stay (LOS) Analysis Using SPSS

## Overview
Performed statistical analysis on patient data to evaluate whether length of stay (LOS) varied significantly across Cardiology, Neurology, and Endocrinology departments. Used SPSS for normality checks, variance testing, ANOVA, and post hoc comparisons.

## Tools Used
- SPSS (IBM)
- Excel (Data Preprocessing)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Descriptive Statistics
- One-Way ANOVA
- Levene's Test for Homogeneity
- Tukey’s Post Hoc Test
- Boxplot Visualization

## Project Steps
1. Cleaned and imported hospital dataset into SPSS.
2. Tested for normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and equal variances (Levene’s Test).
3. Conducted one-way ANOVA to compare LOS across three facilities.
4. Applied Tukey’s post hoc test for pairwise analysis.
5. Visualized findings using boxplots and mean plots.

## Outcome
Identified statistically significant differences in LOS among clinical departments, providing insights into resource allocation and discharge practices.
